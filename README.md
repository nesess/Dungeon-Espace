Info:

This game made with Unity. There is many game mechanics in this game so i suggest you to watch gameplay video to get the idea of game. Although I generally followed the course, I made changes. Such as a complete Enemy AI system. A proper jump animation. Enemy diamond drop with different sizes. This is not a complete game. But many of the game mechanic is implemented the rest is only level design. Lastly thanks to this course I believe my code is very clean, readable and organized I suggest you to check it out.
